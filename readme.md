# TAM FastAPI

This version of Ticket Auction Manager is done up somewhat properly using an API interface instead of pushing the DB calls right out onto the network. It is a bit more efficient and easier to secure (theoretically should be able to be used through an SSH tunnel).

**This is still in active development, nothing works... yet.**
